# Coursera-Capstone_project-Regression-with-Keras
Final project of the course "Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning - IBM". In this project I'm applying the knowlege adquired during the course about how to build regression and classification Deep Learning algorithms with Keras.

The dataset is from the IBM cloud and it's composed of different features of concrete. The target of this algorithm is to predict the strength of the concrete in the test set with the lowest MSE and Standard Deviation.
